# Blender Python Nodes
Blender Python Nodes is a blender addon that enables python programming using only blender nodes

# TODO:
  1. make currently-running node glow/change color to green
  2. make errors turn node red, and be traceable
  3. auto convert python functions into nodes
  4. auto convert python modules into nodes in categories
  5. implement blender utility nodes:
 
    * mix node, compositiong nodes, color ramp, noise generation...
    * input from rendered scenes, compositor nodes, texture nodes
    * input from motion tracking, drivers...
    * bpy commands...
  6. impelemnt lots of NNs into python modules and nodes to be used artstically by blender users with little-no code expierence

    * cyclegan x -> y, person to tom cruz or tom hanks for example. (floor -> beach, person -> celebrity, stone -> wood, greenscreen -> mask, ...)
    * pose transfer for dancing (https://aliaksandrsiarohin.github.io/first-order-model-website/)
    * up-resolution, infilling, image-generation, frame-interpolation
    * material-manipulation in still frames (change glossyness/other attributes of masked object)
    * insert smoke simulation, fluid simulation, fire
    * automatic vegtation insert: trees, plants, plants from picture, bark, rocks, rotateable, clouds
    * automatic time of day, re-lighting gan
    * realism filter. go from cg environments to real-looking environment
    * automatic depth inference from single image, and multiple images
    * gmic qt filters node
    * glsl, osl filters node
    * nft-generator gan
    * expieremental: object re-orientation gan

# Goals:
  1. be able to make crazy tiktoks of people without them knowing using only nf
  2. make well-selling nft art
  3. demonstrate societal changing capicy of nf
  4. fishish before end of summer
