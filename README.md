# Blender Python Nodes
Blender Python Nodes is a blender addon that enables python programming using only blender nodes

# TODO:
  ~~1. make currently-running node glow/change color to green~~

  ~~2. make errors turn node red,~~ and be traceable

 ~~ 3. auto convert python functions into nodes~~

 ~~ 4. auto convert python modules into nodes in categories~~

  5. implement blender utility nodes:

      1. mix node, compositiong nodes, color ramp, noise generation...
      2. input from rendered scenes, compositor nodes, texture nodes
      3. input from motion tracking, drivers...
      ~~4. bpy commands...~~

  6. impelemnt lots of NNs into python modules and nodes to be used artstically by blender users with little-no code expierence

      1. cyclegan x -> y, person to tom cruz or tom hanks for example. (floor -> beach, person -> celebrity, stone -> wood, greenscreen -> mask, ...)
      2. pose transfer for dancing (https://aliaksandrsiarohin.github.io/first-order-model-website/)
      3. up-resolution, infilling, image-generation, frame-interpolation
      4. material-manipulation in still frames (change glossyness/other attributes of masked object)
      5. insert smoke simulation, fluid simulation, fire
      6. automatic vegtation insert: trees, plants, plants from picture, bark, rocks, rotateable, clouds
      7. automatic time of day, re-lighting gan
      8. realism filter. go from cg environments to real-looking environment
      9. automatic depth inference from single image, and multiple images
      10. gmic qt filters node
      11. glsl, osl filters node
      12. nft-generator gan
      13. expieremental: object re-orientation gan

  7. dictionary creation node (fill in sockets as values, and use text input as key)

  8. special functions like if, while, for, try, def, class

# Goals:
  1. be able to make crazy tiktoks of people without them knowing using only nf

  2. make well-selling nft art

  3. demonstrate societal changing capicy of nf
  
  4. finish before end of summer
